## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-22

First public release.

### Added

- **You describe the idea, the agents handle the engineering.** You talk to the Architect to turn the
  idea into a specification with tasks and acceptance criteria, and you approve the plan before any
  code is written.
- **Developer and Reviewer work for you.** Each task is built by the Developer in an isolated copy of
  the project, then tested and checked by the Reviewer; only approved work reaches your project.
- **Everything runs on your computer.** Projects are local Git repositories in `~/NantsProjects`, and
  Nants is a single executable with its interface in the browser.
- **Docker projects.** Tests, checks and the running app live in containers, with nothing installed
  on your system and no `sudo`.
- **Browser testing.** The generated app is opened in a real browser (Playwright), with screenshots
  that you and the Reviewer can see.
- **Follow along and decide.** Your browser shows the conversation, the plan, the tasks,
  the board, the files, the running app and the cost of each step, and you can stop, approve or ask
  for changes at any time.
- **Use the provider you prefer.** Connections to OpenAI compatible providers, one model per role and
  a cost estimate in dollars.
- **The `nants` command.** Opens Nants in the browser on a free port; `nants doctor` checks Docker,
  Compose, Git, the port and disk space, shows the command to fix anything missing and tells you when
  a new version is out.
- **One command install** on Linux and on Windows through WSL:
  `curl -fsSL https://nants.tmdevlab.com/install.sh | sh`.
- **English and Portuguese.** The whole interface in both languages, picked from your browser and
  switchable at any time in Settings. The agents talk, plan and write the report in the chosen
  language; the generated app follows the language of your request.
- **Uninstall.** `nants uninstall` removes the executable; with `--purge`, also the configuration and
  data, always asking first and never touching your projects.
- **Privacy.** No telemetry; API keys stay on your computer.
- **Open source.** Nants is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.
